                        Athens was the Greek capital of Rome, which was inhabited for around 5000 years. The people who
                        lived in Athens mostly consisted of Greeks who came from Asia.
                        Initially, however, Athens was completely evacuated after 1827 due to various wars that were
                        occurring at the time. The place initially had 4000 people, which grew to 1.5 million
                        Greeks over time after various years and forms of rebuilding.
