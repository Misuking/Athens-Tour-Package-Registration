                    <h2>At the Beginning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Athens is one of the world's oldest cities, with evidence of continuous habitation for over 5,000 years.
                        Originally a small Mycenaean settlement, it grew into a powerful city-state that played a central role in
                        Greek civilization. The early inhabitants of Athens were Indo-European migrants, primarily Greeks from
                        Asia Minor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city saw its first major expansion during the Bronze Age, but it was truly during the Archaic period
                        (8th-6th century BCE) that Athens emerged as a dominant power. The establishment of democracy under
                        figures like Solon and Cleisthenes set the foundation for the city’s golden age.

                    <h2>The Classical Golden Age</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 5th century BCE is often referred to as the "Golden Age of Athens." This period saw Athens at its peak,
                        politically, militarily, and culturally. Under the leadership of Pericles, the city built the Parthenon, 
                        established democratic governance, and became the intellectual heart of Greece.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundations of Western thought, while playwrights
                        like Sophocles and Euripides revolutionized theater. The Athenian navy played a crucial role in defending 
                        Greece from Persian invasions, securing the city’s dominance over the Aegean world.

                    <h2>Athens Under Roman and Byzantine Rule</h2>
                    <p>
                        By the 2nd century BCE, Athens fell under Roman control, but its cultural prestige remained. Emperor Hadrian
                        heavily invested in the city, building structures like the Library of Hadrian and the Temple of Olympian Zeus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the Byzantine period (4th-15th century CE), Athens became a provincial town, losing much of its ancient
                        glory. Christianity replaced traditional pagan worship, and many classical temples were repurposed as churches.

                    <h2>The Ottoman Era and Decline</h2>
                    <p>
                        From the mid-15th century to the early 19th century, Athens was under Ottoman rule. The city became a small,
                        provincial town, far from its former grandeur. Many historical sites, including the Parthenon, were damaged
                        or repurposed during this period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite this, Athens retained a sense of identity and was a focal point for Greek resistance movements. The
                        Greek War of Independence in 1821 marked the beginning of the city’s modern rebirth.

                    <h2>The Rebirth of Athens</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following Greece’s independence in 1834, Athens was declared the capital of the new Greek state. At the time,
                        it was little more than a village of 4,000 people, but rapid expansion soon followed. Neoclassical buildings
                        were constructed, and efforts were made to restore the city’s ancient ruins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Athens has grown into a thriving European metropolis. Today, it stands
                        as a global cultural hub, blending its rich historical legacy with modern innovation.
